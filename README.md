# graph_basics
basic graph algorithms implementation for 2018 spring Discrete Maths class @ Tsinghua University

Algorithms include:

* Bipartite graph perfect matching: **Hungary Algorithm** - match_and_flow.cpp
* Maximum network flow: **Edmonds-Kart Algorithm** - match_and_flow.cpp
* Huffman tree
* Dijkstra

Among which, _match_and_flow.cpp_ is the solution for [Codeforces 103E](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/103/E)
